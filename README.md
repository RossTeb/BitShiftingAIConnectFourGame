# BitShiftingAIConnectFourGame
This project is a heuristic algorithm designed to play connect four on a M by N connect R board. 
m/n being the dimensions r being the amount required for a win.
The algorithm uses bit shifting to assess the game state and make a move. 
The code remains uncommented and is quite extensive, an explanation can be given upon reuqest. 

Give it a try you might find the computer player to be hard to beat.
